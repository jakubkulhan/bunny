     * Calling just `Client::disconnect` instead of running the code in this
     * method does only work as (probably) expected (ie. actually close the
     * connection to the broker) if the client does not have any open channels.
     * Otherwise, `Client::disconnect` waits for `Channel::close` on open
     * channels to complete which is promise-based and needs a running event
     * loop (`Client::run`) to be able to fulfill its promise. If there is no
     * running event loop after calling `Client::disconnect`, the client will
     * stay connected until its destructor is called or the connection is
     * closed by the broker (eg. because of missing a heartbeat event).
     *
     * The code in this method contains the same logic as `Client::__destruct`.
